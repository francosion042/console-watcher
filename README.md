[![Publish Package to npmjs](https://github.com/francosion042/console-watcher/actions/workflows/npm-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/francosion042/console-watcher/actions/workflows/npm-publish.yml)

A NodeJs development tool that intercepts your appâ€™s 'console.log()', 'console.info()' and 'console.error()' statements, stores them for you, and lets you visualise them in a .log, .txt or .json file in your app directory or on your personal dashboard (coming soon)
